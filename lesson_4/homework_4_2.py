# FOR LOOPS EXERCISES

# Ex. 1
# Enter your name, save it in name variable and save in result_1 variable your name repeated 3 times (use loops)

# name_1 = input("Please, enter your name: ")
# result_1 = ''
# for x in range(3):
#     result_1 += name_1
# print(result_1)

# TODO: Here is your code


# Ex. 2
# Modify your previous program so that it will enter your name (save it in variable  name_2) and a number
# (save in variable number) and then save in result_2 variable your name repeated as many times as number_1 is
# (use loops)
# name_2 = input("Please, enter your name: ")
# number_1 = input("Please, enter your number: ")
# result_2 = ""
# for x in range(int(number_1)):
#     result_2 += name_2
# print(result_2)

# Ex. 3
# Enter a random string, which includes only digits. Write code which find a sum of digits in this string and save it
# into result_3 variable

# string_number_1 = input("Enter a random number: ")
# result_3 = 0
#
# for x in string_number_1:
#     result_3 += int(x)
# print(result_3)

# Ex. 4
# Create code which sums up all even numbers between 2 and 100 (include 100) and save it in result_4 variable

#     x = i + x
